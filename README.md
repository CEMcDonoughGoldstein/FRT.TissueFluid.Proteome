Analysis for "Female reproductive tract gene expression reveals tissue-specific rapid molecular evolution and coordinated mating responses in Drosophila" to be published in G3

In order to better understand the female reproductive tract (FRT) we conducted a systematic, comprehensive investigation of the FRT in a tssue-specific manner at three time points relative to mating. By characterizing the transcriptional relationships among discrete FRT tissues across time we advance the understanding of the molecular genetics of FRT functions. We conducted RNAseq of five FRT tissues (bursa, oviduct, seminal receeptacle, spermatheca, and parovaria) as well as the FRT-associated fat body in unmated females as well as females 6hrs and 24hrs post-mating.

Raw data is available from GEO accession GSE143759

Other data neccesary for analyses - gene length, name conversion, chromosome and position, molecular evolution, and ModEncode expression.

This repository includes all data and code necessary to replicate the analyses reproted in the manuscript. The code is found in "FRT.Transcriptomics.Analysis.Submitted.rmd" and the raw data is "FRT.Clean.txt". The normalized data set is included as "FRT.normalized.txt" and the supplemental table 1 outputs with average expression for each sample "Supp1.AvgExpression.txt" and summary of all anlayses "Supp1.summary.txt".
